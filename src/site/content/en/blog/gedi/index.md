## Introduction

Based in Rome, Italy, and formed in 1976, [GEDI](http://www.gedispa.it/) is a
media company that publishes 12 newspapers, several magazines, radio stations,
and 15 news sites. Their stable of publications includes
[La Stampa](https://www.lastampa.it/) and
[La Repubblica](https://www.repubblica.it/).

While GEDI is present in traditional publishing and broadcasting, its content
is increasingly being consumed on the web, and web is now contributing
significantly to their advertising revenue. Therefore, user retention and user
experience on the web are vital to the company's overall prosperity.

## Challenge

According to Giuseppe Covato, Head of Innovation and New Technologies at GEDI
Digital, before 2017, they didn't have a strategic path for web performance.
Knowledge sharing between teams was minimal and inefficient. In particular, it
was hard to get marketing on board on technical topics such as Core Web Vitals.

With the introduction of Rep, a new premium content site, the Digital
team took the opportunity to experiment with emerging technologies such as
Polymer, AMP, and [progressive web apps](/progressive-web-apps/) (PWA). The
project also served as a playground to upscale the team around
performance-related objectives.

## Optimizations

To address performance, the team first applied
[critical rendering path
optimization](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/critical-rendering-path/optimizing-critical-rendering-path),
making sure there was no CSS or JavaScript that could slow down the rendering
time of editorial content.  This included deferring third-party scripts and
non-critical CSS, inlining critical CSS, and avoiding JavaScript lazy loading
on the first in-viewport images.

The team then spent some time optimizing the site layout for stability. For
example, they reserved space for images based on their aspect ratio. They also
reserved space for the top ad in the viewport and later for the mid-page ads.
This ensured users can read an article without interruption from annoying
content jumps.

## Results 

The new site became one of the fastest GEDI newspaper sites based on the key
metrics such as [Time to First Byte](/ttfb/) (TTFB) and [First Contentful Paint](/fcp/) (FCP). The team used
what they learned to scale this innovation to other high-traffic sites, such as
La Stampa and La Repubblica.

</ul>

And, the benefits were measurable: on the La Repubblica mobile site, for
example, they measured a 77% reduction in [Cumulative Layout Shift](/cls/)
(CLS) and a 26% improvement in time to [Largest Contentful Paint](/lcp/)
(LCP). Overall, the team found they reduced La Repubblica's mobile bounce
rate by 8%.
