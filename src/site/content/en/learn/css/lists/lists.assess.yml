    stem: The default `flex-direction` is
    options:
      - content: "`row`"
        rationale: "By default, flexbox will fit items into a row, lining them
        up at the start. With wrapping turned on, it will continue creating rows
        for children to flow within."
      - content: "`column`"
        rationale: "Setting flex-direction to column is a great way to stack
        elements, but it is not the default value."
