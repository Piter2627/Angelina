  Learn strategies for writing effective instruction on web.dev.
---

Most web.dev content includes at least some instruction. These guidelines help make your instruction easier to follow.

*  Explain _why_ to do something before explaining _how_ to do it. Knowing the
   end goal helps readers understand the purpose of individual steps.
*  Keep the scope of instruction manageable. If a task is complex, find ways to
   break up the steps. For example, provide the essential pieces in a post and
   put the ancillary pieces in one or more codelabs. If one process has many
   steps, consider grouping parts of the proceess with sub-headings.
*  Always provide examples for complex or abstract concepts. If you're debating
   whether to give an example, add one.

Use web.dev's built-in [Instruction
components](/handbook/web-dev-components#instruction) for common tasks that are
often referenced on the site (for example, instructions about opening Glitch or
Chrome DevTools). This approach provides a consistent user experience and makes
it easy to update instructions across the site when needed.

## Inclusive instruction

Be mindful of [voice](/handbook/voice). To avoid alienating your readers, try to
strike a balance between showing expertise and humility.

Avoid words and phrases that make it sound like a concept or task is easy or
obvious&mdash;it may not be! For example, the following words and phrases can
frustrate readers when a task turns out to be harder: _obviously_, _simply_, _of course_, _clearly_, _just_, _everyone knows_, and _easy_.

Our readers have different educational backgrounds and experiences. A person may
be an expert of their own industry but not know anything about the topic
discussed in an article.

accessibility](handbook/inclusion-and-accessibility).

## Test and seek feedback

To write the best instructions, it's important to test your steps and seek
feedback. It's possible that you will miss a piece of instruction that seems like
common knowledge, when actually a new reader  wouldn't know to follow that step.

Asking for feedback will help ensure your language is clear. This feedback can
come as a review of your pull request.
